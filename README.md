## üß† LeetCode High-Performance Solutions

A curated collection of LeetCode problems solved with **high-performance, low-complexity algorithms**, written in C++ and Python.
Each solution is designed to optimize for **time complexity**, targeting `O(1)` or `O(log n)` wherever algorithmically possible.

> üìà This repository is more than a solution bank ‚Äî it's a library of interview-grade, optimized algorithm patterns.

### üöÄ Features

* ‚úÖ **Zero/Logarithmic-Time Complexity First**:
  Most solutions are implemented with an emphasis on reducing time complexity to `O(1)` / `O(log n)` where applicable.

* üß© **Clean, Readable Code**:
  Code is written in concise style with meaningful variable names and necessary inline explanations.

* üìÇ **Organized by Problem ID and Name**:
  All files follow a `ID.Problem-Title.cpp` or `.py` naming convention.

* üìå **Tags and Categories**:
  Problems are categorized by type (e.g. Arrays, Graphs, Dynamic Programming).

* üîÅ **Auto-synced via LeetHub v2.0**:
  All accepted submissions are pushed directly after successful submission.

### üß† Philosophy

**"I do not solve problems to make them go away ‚Äî I solve them to make them elegant."**  
> *For true excellence lies not in mere correctness, but in clarity, grace, and precision.*
Even though this project has just begun, it is built on a clear philosophy:  
Not all accepted answers are equal ‚Äî **only the most refined survive here**.
